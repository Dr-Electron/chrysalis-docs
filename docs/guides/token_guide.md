# Chrysalis Migration

With the advent of the Chrysalis migration, a number of aspects at IOTA are changing for the better. With easier ways to manage and secure your experience, IOTA will seamlessly integrate these innovations with no service interruptions.

With Chrysalis, we make a clear cut from the current IOTA protocol, and start a new with a much better, and more mature network. The new network will support many new use cases and create a foundation for IOTAâ€™s upcoming Coordicide.

This includes one of the innovations that directly impacts one of the most crucial aspects of your experience: funds.

Because of its complexity, the migration process for the next phase of Chrysalis consists of two phases; we are currently in phase one where you initiate the migration of your funds in one week and which will then be available on our new network upon launch.

Do note that migrating is a continuous effort that can be done at any time after the initial migration start date.

# Token Migration

Below is an overview of how the migration will take place:



## Migration Overview

- You enter your seed in Firefly.
- Firefly creates you a new seed and generates an EdDSA address for the new network.
- Firefly sends your funds to a predetermined migration address on the old network.
- Your funds become available on the network, in the EdDSA address Firefly created for you. 
- If you migrate before Chrysalis launch, your funds become available at Chrysalis launch. 
- If you migrate after Chrysalis launch, your funds will become available shortly after you migrate.
- The process will be the same for Ledger Nano users. 
  - Note: The Ledger will not be supported prior to the Chrysalis launch, but after
- You simply connect your device and Firefly guides you through the process.
- Firefly will initially only be available on Mac, Linux and Windows.
- Your funds are successfully migrated.
