# IOTA Client Library

The official client library for interacting with the IOTA Tangle allows you to:

- Create messages and transactions.
- Sign transactions.
- Generate addresses.
- Interact with an IOTA node.

If you mainly intend to process value transfers, we recommend you use our stateful [wallet library](wallet.md) instead.
